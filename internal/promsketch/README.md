<h1 align="center">PromSketch: Approximation-First Timeseries Query at Scale</h1>


## About

PromSketch is an approximation-first timeseries query framework serving as intermediate result caches for cloud telemetry systems. It eliminates two major query bottlnecks in window-based aggregation queries, i.e., 1) repeated data scans, and 2) repeated query computation concerning window overlaps in rule queries. 

<p align="center"> <img src="./doc/images/prometheus_diagram.png" alt="" width="600"> </p>

PromSketch combines approximate window-based query frameworks, e.g., Exponential Historgrams, and sketch-based precomputation as algorithmic building blocks. It can serve as a plugin to Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, two representative cloud monitoring systems, and significantly reduces query latency operational dollar costs.

Check out our PromSketch [demo](https://youtu.be/skoXfeZZj4I), [paper](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol18/p2348-zhu.pdf), and a [standalone PromSketch](https://github.com/Froot-NetSys/Promsketch-Standalone) implementation as well!
